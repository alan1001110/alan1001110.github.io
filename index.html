            <h1>Callback Functions</h1>
            <p>Before I looked more into callback functions in JavaScript, I wasn't really sure what I didn't know. After all, I seem to have been using them in my example functions. But I was pretty sure I didn't have a good handle on callback functions yet.</p>
            <p>Basically, a callback function is a function passed to another function as an argument.</p>
            <p>So how would it work to pass a function as an argument to another function? Does it always just execute automatically when the first function is completed? How do you pass it arguments? Or do you have to describe how to handle it?</p>
            <p>Let's just try making our own and see what happens...</p>
            <pre><code>function doSomething(x, y, z) {
    console.log(x, z);
}

function mainFunction(a, b, callback) {
    var str = "Dude";
    callback(a, b, str);
}

mainFunction("Hello", "Goodbye", doSomething);

// Hello Dude
</code></pre>
            <p>That's basically all there is to it. I'll ignore setting <code>this</code> with <code>call</code> or <code>apply</code>for now, since I'll be getting into object oriented programming in a later post. What useful thing could we do with callbacks that we couldn't do as easily with an <code>if</code> statement?</p>
            <p>Let's say you have an app where when you want user input for one thing or another, you want to pop up a dialogue box to get user input, and then do something with that input data. But maybe down the road, you'll change things. You could do something like this:</p>
            <pre><code>&LTscript&GT
  function getInput(message, callback) {
    callback(window.prompt(message));
  }

  function notifyLength(str) {
    window.alert("Your string is " + str.length + " characters.");
  }

  function sayHelloTo(str) {
    window.alert("Hello " + str +"!");
  }
&LT/script&GT

&LTbutton onclick="getInput('Type something and check how many characters.', notifyLength)"&GTCount characters&LT/button&GT
&LTbutton onclick="getInput('Who do you want to say hello to?', sayHelloTo)"&GTSay Hello to Someone&LT/button&GT</code></pre>
            <script>
                function getInput(message, callback) {
                    callback(window.prompt(message));
                }

                function notifyLength(str) {
                    window.alert("Your string is " + str.length + " characters.");
                }

                function sayHelloTo(str) {
                    window.alert("Hello " + str +"!");
                }

            </script>
            <button onclick="getInput('Type something and check how many characters.', notifyLength)">Count characters</button>
            <button onclick="getInput('Who do you want to say hello to?', sayHelloTo)">Say Hello to Someone</button>
            <p>Is a callback useful in this case? Compare to a standard function call. What if our <code>getInput</code> function looked like this:</p>
            <pre><code>function getInput(message) {
   return window.prompt(message);
}</code></pre>
            <p>For your onclick event, you could call:</p>
            <pre><code>notifyLength(getInput("Type something and check how many characters."));</code></pre>
            <p>In this case, using a callback doesn't seem at all useful. It could be useful if you want to execute a callback in the middle of the other function.  Or if you need to wait for a server response, a callback could execute once it's ready, if tied to an event listener (?), without holding up the flow of the program. I'm not going to get into that right now.</p>
            <p>Other things that might be good to do are make callbacks optional and check if the callback argument is a function like so:</p>
            <pre><code>if (callback && typeof callback === "function") {
  callback();
}</code></pre>

            <h1>Arrow functions</h1>
            <p>Arrow functions in JavaScript are fairly new, and I haven't been exposed to them much yet. The MDN documentation says that there were two reasons for bringing arrow functions into the language. These are shorter functions, and lexically bound <code>this</code>.</p>
            <p>Shorter functions:</p>
            <pre><code>Array.map(function(a) {return a * 2});
Array.map(a =&GT a * 2);</code></pre>
            <p>Lexically bound <code>this</code> (if I understand correctly) means that <code>this</code> refers to the object in which the function is found, rather than the object the function call is made from. See the following example:</p>
            <pre><code>window.x = 3;

function Multiplier() {
    this.x = 2;
    this.doubler = function (arr) {
        return arr.map(num =&GT num * this.x); //
    };

    this.tripler = function (arr) {
        return arr.map (function(num) {
            return num * this.x;
        });
    };
}

var myMult = new Multiplier;

console.log(myMult.doubler([1, 2, 3])); // 2, 4, 6
console.log(myMult.tripler([1, 2, 3])); // 3, 6, 9</code></pre>
            <p>In the example above, the doubler uses an arrow function and therefore. Therefore, <code>this</code> refers to the object the function is found in (<code>myMult</code> in this case). On the other hand, the tripler uses a standard function expression, and therefore, since the function was not called from within any object other than the window object, <code>this</code> refers to the window object. (If I understand correctly.)</p>
            <p>One thing to note is that if you use the <code>arguments</code> keyword in an arrow function, it will not refer to parameters passed to the arrow function, but rather parameters passed to the function that the arrow function is contained in, aka the enclosing scope. (IIUC)</p>

            <h1>Array.reduce(), Array.filter(), &AMP Array.sort()</h1>
            <p>Array.reduce() is used to primarily to reduce an Array to a single value. Its syntax is <code>Array.reduce(callback[, initial value])</code> and the callback function takes four arguments: <code>previousValue, currentValue, currentIndex, array</code>. The first time I read through the documentaion, it was a little confusing, but on the second read-through, it seemed simple.</p>
            <p>I'm not going to explain it now here now or give an example because I don't think I'd do better than the MDN, and I don't think I'd get much out of the exercise. Array.sort() and Array.filter() are a couple other Array methods that I've just reviewed. I haven't been using them in my own code, but they could clean up code by getting rid of for loops and if statements.</p>
            <p>Here are some examples that make use of the arrow function, which I'll be looking at in the next post. I've taken some of them from the MDN.</p>
            <pre><code>var flatArr = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]].reduce( (prev, curr) =&GT prev.concat(curr) );
//flatArr is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6

var summedArr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].reduce( (prev, current) =&GT prev + current );
// summedArr is 49

var noRepeats = [8, 5, 5, 6, 1, 8, 3, 4, 5].filter( (value, index, arr) =&GT arr.slice(0, index).indexOf(value) === -1);
// noRepeats is 8, 5, 6, 1, 3, 4

var sortedArr = [8, 40, 6, 23, 7, 80, 8, 2, 3, 0].sort( (a, b) =&GT a - b );
// sortedArr is 0, 2, 3, 6, 7, 8, 8, 23, 40, 80</code></pre>
            <p>Moving on...</p>

            <h1>Array.map()</h1>
            <p>While I had read the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">documentation</a> on <code>Array.map()</code> before, I'd never put it into practice. Nor did I understand how using it would be beneficial. Nevermind that I couldn't remember the difference between <code>Array.map()</code> and <code>Array.reduce()</code>.</p>
            <p>To get myself up to speed, first I reviewed the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map">syntax</a>. It's not all that hard to understand. I'm not going to repeat the documentation, so have a look if you need.  So why is it useful if you can do the exact same thing with a <code>for</code> loop. A Google search of "Why use Array.map()?" tells me that it's slightly easier to read. Let's take a look at an example. First is an <code>Array.map()</code> method that multiplies each value in an array by the index number.</p>
            <pre><code>var arr = [10, 3, 7, 3, 0, -1, 16];
var newArr = arr.map(function(currentValue, index) {
  return currentValue * index;
});

// [0, 3, 14, 9, 0, -5, 96]
            </code></pre>
            <p>Now let's take a look at a <code>for</code> loop for comparison...</p>
            <pre><code>var arr2 = [10, 3, 7, 3, 0, -1, 16];
var newArr2 = [];
for (var i = 0; i &LT arr2.length; i++) {
    newArr2.push(i * arr2[i]);
}

// [0, 3, 14, 9, 0, -5, 96]
            </code></pre>
            <p>The Array.map() version is one line shorter. In a four line program, that's 25% less reading &AMP writing, so it's probably worth adopting. But is this just a fabricated exercise or could I clean up some of my code right away? A quick look through code I've written for projects unfortunately didn't turn up anything that Array.map() would be appropriate for. At least it's in my toolbelt for the future.</p>

            <h1>JavaScript that I know I Don't Know</h1>
            <p>I've been doing basic JavaScript challenges using using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Soon I'll be building on my JavaScript knowledge and exploring Node, React, D3 and more. But before pressing on, I would like to narrow some of the gaps in my grasp of the language itself. Here are a few things that I don't know or understand well:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Array.map()</li>
                <li>Array.filter()</li>
                <li>Arrow functions</li>
                <li>Callback Functions</li>
                <li>Constructor and Factory Functions</li>
                <li>Closures</li>
                <li>Errors and Exceptions</li>
                <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Coming up, I intend to figure it all out and write a post on each that outlines what I've been confused about, share how I manage to grok it, and then explain the concepts in my own words.</p>

            <h1>Choosing an Editor</h1>
            <p>After trying a few text editors and a couple IDE's, I've recently settled in with <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>. It's perfect for the web stuff I'm doing now. First, a little about what else I tried.</p>
            <p>I started out with Notepad++ (free), but I wanted a little more. I downloaded Vim, but wasn't fond of the initial feel, and didn't spend much time with it.</p>
            <p>I tried the Netbeans IDE and Cloud 9's IDE's, but they're so slow in comparison to a text-editor, and I found that frustrating.</p>
            <p>I loved the speed of Sublime and the look of its default <i>Monokai</i> theme, but my brief attempt at trying to install custom packages was frustrating. I also didn't want to pay for it while still trying it out, and not making an income at coding. The constant pop-ups asking for money were annoying.</p>
            <p>I read about Atom, but didn't feel the need to try it out.</p>
            <p>Visual Studio Code was pretty good, but I didn't like it quite as much as Brackets.</p>
            <p>Which brings me to what I like about Brackets. It feels slick and professional. It's fast. It's open-source and free. It has a built-in Live Preview feature that works with the Chrome browser and updates as you type. (Live Preview can be used for either static sites or with a back-end server.) Brackets is also super-easy to customize with third-party linters, debuggers, themes, and more if you want to replace or build on what it already comes with. Just click the Extension Manager that looks like a Lego block in the upper right corner, select an extension, click install, and Bob's your uncle.</p>
            <p>My key customizations: First, I chose the <i>Monokai</i> theme and bumped the font size up a little to make it look a lot like Sublime. Second, I installed the <i>Brackets Git</i> extension by Martin Zegora. It is surprisingly full-featured and a pleasure to use.</p>
            <p>I've also got <i>Brackets-InteractiveLinter</i> installed, plus a couple other extensions.</p>
            <p>For anyone starting out in web development with Javascript/Node, I highly recommend Brackets (especially with my key customizations).</p>

            <h1>Hello World!!!</h1>
            <p>My name is Alan and I'm learning to code. I'd like to share my journey.</p>
            <p>As my very first step down the programming path, I delved into <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/"><i>Learn Python The Hard Way</i></a> by Zed Shaw. A friend had told me Python would be a good language to learn first, and Google told me a lot of people thought <i>LPTHW</i> was a good book for learning Python.</p>
            <p>About two thirds of the way through the book, I googled "What programming language should I learn first?" What I found always boiled down to either, "It doesn't matter" or "Learn JavaScript first." So I started learning JavaScript instead, and promptly forgot what Python I'd learned thus far.</p>
            <p>My primary resource for JavaScript learning has been <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. I'm loving it. It lays out a complete track for learning web development from start to finish, and ends with doing coding projects for non-profits. You can take a look my Free Code Camp activity <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/alan1001110">here</a>.</p>
