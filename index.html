    <h1>Hello World!!!</h1>
    <p>  My name is Alan, and I'm learning to code. A friend recommended I start with Python, so I started going through 'Learn Python The Hard Way'.  Then I googled, "what programming language to learn first?" and read what many people wrote on the subject. The answers always came down to either "It doesn't matter," or "Learn Javascript first." So I started learning Javascript. My primary resource so far has been <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. </p>
