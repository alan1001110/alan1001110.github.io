            <h1>Hello World!!!</h1>
            <p>My name is Alan and I'm learning to code. I'd like to share my journey.</p>
            <p>As my very first step down the programming path, I delved into <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/"><i>Learn Python The Hard Way</i></a> by Zed Shaw. A friend had told me Python would be a good language to learn first, and Google told me a lot of people thought <i>LPTHW</i> was a good book for learning Python.</p>
            <p>About two thirds of the way throught the book, I googled "What programming language should I learn first?" What I found always boiled down to either, "It doesn't matter" or "Learn JavaScript first." So I started learning JavaScript instead, and promptly forgot what Python I'd learned thus far.</p>
            <p>My primary resource for JavaScript learning has been <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. I'm loving it. It lays out a complete track for learning web development from start to finish, and ends with doing coding projects for non-profits. You can take a look my Free Code Camp activity <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/alan1001110">here</a>.</p>

            <h1>Choosing an Editor</h1>
            <p>After trying a few text editors and a couple IDE's, I've recently settled in with <a href="http://brackets.io">Brackets</a>. It's perfect for the web stuff I'm doing now. First, a little about what else I tried.</p>
            <p>I started out with Notepad++ (free), but I wanted a little more.</p>
            <p>I tried Netbeans and Cloud 9's IDE's, but they're so slow in comparison to a text-editor, and I found that frustrating.</p>
            <p>I loved the speed of Sublime and its default <i>Monokai</i> theme, but my brief attempt at trying to install custom packages was frustrating. I also didn't want to pay for it while still trying it out, and not making an income at coding. The constant pop-ups asking for money were annoying.</p>
            <p>I read about Atom, but didn't feel the need to try it out.</p>
            <p>Visual Studio Code was pretty good, but I didn't like it quite as much as Brackets.</p>
            <p>Which brings me what I like about Brackets. It feels slick and professional. It's fast. It's open-source and free. It has a built-in Live Preview feature that works with the Chrome browser and updates as you type. (Live Preview can be used for either static sites or with a back-end server.) Brackets is also super-easy to customize with third-party linters, debuggers, themes, and more if you want to replace or build on what it already comes with. Just click the Extension Manager that looks like a Lego block in the upper right corner, select an extension, click install, and Bob's your uncle.</p>
            <p>My key customizations: First, I chose the <i>Monokai</i> theme and bumped the font size up a little to make it look a lot like Sublime. Second, I installed the <i>Brackets Git</i> extension by Martin Zegora. It is surprisingly full-featured and a pleasure to use.</p>
            <p>I've also got <i>Brackets-InteractiveLinter</i> installed, plus a couple other extensions.</p>
            <p>For anyone starting out in web development with Javascript/Node, I highly recommend Brackets (especially with my key customizations).</p>

            <h1>JavaScript that I know I Don't Know</h1>
            <p>I've been doing basic JavaScript challenges using using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript. Soon I'll be building on my JavaScript knowledge and exploring Node, React, D3 and more. But before pressing on, I would like to narrow some of the gaps in my grasp of the language itself. Here are a few things that I don't know or understand well:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Array.map()</li>
                <li>Array.filter()</li>
                <li>Constructor and Factory Functions</li>
                <li>Callback Functions</li>
                <li>Closures</li>
                <li>Errors and Exceptions</li>
                <li>Object Oriented Programming</li>
                <li>Fat Arrow Functions</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Coming up, I intend to figure it all out and write a post on each that outlines what I've been confused about, share how I manage to grok it, and then explain the concepts in my own words.</p>
