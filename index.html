            <h1>Hello World!!!</h1>
            <p>My name is Alan and I'm learning to code. I'd like to share my journey.</p>

            <p>As my very first step down the programming path, I delved into <a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python The Hard Way</a> by Zed Shaw. A friend had told me Python would be a good language to learn first, and Google had told me a lot of people thought <i>LPTHW</i> would be a good book for learning Python.</p>

            <p>When I started getting bored with the book, I googled, "What programming language should I learn first?" What I found always boiled down to either, "It doesn't matter" or "Learn Javascript first." So I started learning Javascript instead, and promptly forgot what Python I'd learned thus far.</p>

            <p>My primary resource for Javascript learning has been <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>. I'm loving it. It lays out a complete track for learning web development from start to finish, and ends with doing coding projects for non-profits. You can take a look my Free Code Camp activity <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/alan1001110">here</a>.</p>
